**Name:** Laravel Artisan Runner
**Type:** Laravel package
**Purpose:** Run allowlisted or auto-discovered Artisan commands from a Livewire UI
with full audit logging and notifications.
**Repo:** <https://github.com/cleaniquecoders/laravel-artisan-runner>

## Architecture

### Key Patterns

- `PackageServiceProvider` via Spatie for config/migration/views/routes registration
- Contracts in `src/Contracts/`, implementations in `src/Actions/`
- Action classes: one class, focused responsibility
- Queued jobs for async command execution
- Livewire registration: `addNamespace()` on LW4, `component()` fallback on LW3
- Polymorphic `ran_by` for tracking who ran each command

### Directory Structure

```text
src/
├── Actions/
│   ├── DiscoverCommandsAction.php
│   ├── ResolveCommandsAction.php
│   └── RunCommandAction.php
├── Commands/
│   └── DiscoverCommandsCommand.php
├── Contracts/
│   └── CommandRunnerContract.php
├── Enums/
│   ├── CommandStatus.php
│   └── DiscoveryMode.php
├── Jobs/
│   └── RunArtisanCommandJob.php
├── Livewire/
│   └── CommandRunner.php
├── Models/
│   └── CommandLog.php
├── Notifications/
│   └── CommandCompletedNotification.php
└── ArtisanRunnerServiceProvider.php
```

### Database

- **Primary key:** Auto-increment `id` (internal) + UUID `uuid` (public)
- **UUID:** Generated on `creating` event via `Str::uuid()`
- **Status:** Backed enum cast (`CommandStatus`)
- **Parameters:** JSON column cast to `AsCollection`
- **Polymorphic:** `ran_by_type` / `ran_by_id` via `morphTo()`

### Discovery Pipeline

```text
Config (discovery_mode)
  ├── manual  → allowed_commands only
  ├── auto    → DiscoverCommandsAction - excluded → merge with manual
  └── selection → DiscoverCommandsAction (included only) → merge with manual
```

Manual entries always take precedence. Results cached via `discovery_cache_ttl`.

---

## DO / DON'T

- ✅ DO use `ResolveCommandsAction` to get available commands (not config directly)
- ❌ DON'T bypass allowlist — always go through `CommandRunnerContract`
- ✅ DO use index-based keys for Livewire `parameterValues` (not param names)
- ❌ DON'T use `wire:model="parameterValues.--force"` — dashes break Livewire binding
- ✅ DO use `method_exists` check for Livewire registration (LW4: `addNamespace()`, LW3: `component()`)
- ❌ DON'T hardcode either registration method — the service provider handles both
- ✅ DO pass `recentLogs` via `render()` return — not as computed property
- ❌ DON'T use computed properties for data that must refresh on poll
- ✅ DO use `config:clear` (not `cache:clear`) in tests — cache store may not exist
- ❌ DON'T run blocking commands in HTTP cycle — always dispatch to queue

---

## Preferences

### Code Style

- Return types declared explicitly
- Strict types not enforced (standard Laravel package convention)
- No docblocks unless adding non-obvious context

### Testing

- Pest with `it()` blocks (no `describe()` grouping currently)
- Test file mirrors src path: `tests/RunCommandActionTest.php`
- `beforeEach` for shared config setup
- `Queue::fake()` for dispatch tests
- `CommandLogFactory` with state methods: `pending()`, `running()`,
  `completed()`, `failed()`

### Git

- Descriptive commit messages (not conventional commits prefix)
- Co-authored-by Claude in commits
- Don't push until explicitly asked

### Livewire

- Registration is version-aware: `addNamespace()` on LW4, `component()` on LW3
- Views referenced as `artisan-runner::livewire.command-runner`
- Component tag: `<livewire:artisan-runner::command-runner />`

---

## Gotchas

- `cache:clear` fails in Orchestra Testbench because the `database` cache store
  (from testbench .env) doesn't exist. Use `config:clear` in tests instead.
- Livewire 4 computed properties are cached within a single request. Data that
  needs to refresh on `wire:poll` must be passed through `render()` return.
- `Livewire::addNamespace()` is LW4-only. The service provider uses
  `method_exists` to fall back to `Livewire::component()` for LW3.
- `wire:model` with `--` prefixed keys (e.g., `parameterValues.--force`) breaks
  in Livewire. Use index-based keys and map back to param names in `run()`.
- `testbench serve` uses in-memory SQLite by default. Create a file-based
  `database.sqlite` and run `migrate:fresh` for persistence across requests.
- Artisan `migrate --step` is a boolean flag (run individually), not a number.
  Don't confuse with `migrate:rollback --step` which is a count.
